        <p>
          Indian law now requires companies to give 2% of their profits to
          charity. After all, a bone to the dog is not charity. Charity is the
          bone shared with the dog, when you are just as hungry as the dog. So,
          a corporate can donate either with a bitter feeling that they are
          being forced or with open arms, as an opportunity to make a
          difference. Dream Girl Foundation has made charity easier than ever. A
          corporate can partner with Dream Girl Foundation and in turn help
          needy children by using one (or more) of the following partnerships

                World's literacy rate at 86% (with some countries with 100%)
                dwarfs India's literacy at a meager 74%. Poor literacy is one of
                the biggest factors thwarting the growth of India. We believe
                that an investment in knowledge pays the biggest interest. So,
                Dream Girl Foundation sets up Non-formal education centers in
                backward areas where children don't have access or don't attend
                schools. Dream Girl Foundation provides free of cost state of
                the art education to children who can't afford schools. Our
                philosophy is Children must be taught how to think, not what to
                think. Don't feel like you are too small to make.a change
                anymore and enroll with our NFE Partnership program because in
                learning one teaches and in teaching one learns. Cost of
                operating one NFE center is 9 lakh Rupees. A corporate can
                sponsor one or more NFE centers. It is up to the corporate to
                sponsor NFEs in nearby areas or far away areas. Details of all
                the children helped by the sponsored NFE center(s) will be
                shared with the corporate.

                There is no feeling more appeasing than helping a terminally ill
                child. Knowing that your donation saved a child's life and then
                that child grew up to be a doctor who saves others' life is
                truly joyous and tranquilizing. You can get the same feeling as
                thousands of our donors', by enrolling to our partnership for
                health projects. Dream Girl Foundation firmly believes that the
                secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.
                Dream Girl Foundation has so far helped hundreds of children
                with cancer, tumor and other lethal medical conditions. We don't
                only provide financial support, but also give moral support to
                the family of patient. We believe that we only have what we
                give. Corporates can enroll to this partnership in one (or more)
                of the following 3 ways:

                <li>
                  Establishing fund: A corporate can establish fund and as many
                  people as the fund allows will be treated. Details and genuine
                  discharge summary of all the patients will be given to
                  corporate on annual basis.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Area-wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund just the
                  patients of a particular region.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Disease wise treatment: Corporate can choose to fund patients
                  of just a set of diseases. Corporate can choose the disease
                  whose patients' treatment will be funded.

                that a thing useless to one person can be a gift to another. You
                will be amazed to know how dear your “useless” things can be to
                poor children. So, corporate can inform its employees that
                donation boxes will be in the ofice for some time and that they
                can donate anything that they feel is useless. Employees can

                This type of donation is very interesting. In this type
                employees are encouraged to donate. And the corporate doubles
                the total amount collected from donation of all employees. This
                acts as an incentive for employees to donate as much as possible
                because for every penny the employee donates, the needy children
                get 2 pennies

                  <b>Social Media Marketing:</b> We will make sure to promulgate
                  your good name through our Facebook and Twitter page. It is
                  our job to make mass aware that somewhere there is a corporate
                  that apart from making profit, is also going to great extent
                  to help poor children.

                  <b>Tax Exemption:</b> According to Section-80G of Income-Tax
                  Act, the amount donated towards charity attracts benefits in
                  form of deduction in taxes. This is a value-added benefit that
                  makes the case for donating even stronger.
